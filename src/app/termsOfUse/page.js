          of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information stored electronically
          on data archives or back-up systems or to comply with the laws or
          regulations applicable to the Receiving Party, provided that such
          copies shall at all times be subject to the terms of this Agreement

        <h1>9. Indemnification</h1>
        <p>
          9.1 Indemnification by ekai: ekai agrees to defend or settle, at
          ekai’s expense, a third-party claim or cause of action against
          Customer alleging with specificity that, standing alone, the Service
          or its use: (i) infringes a copyright or patent of such third party;
          or (ii) infringes all inventive aspects of a patent of such third
          party (“Claim”) and to pay damages finally awarded against Customer by
          a court of competent jurisdiction or as agreed to in a settlement.
          ekai’s obligations hereunder do not apply with respect to any Claim
          that arises out of: (a) any unauthorised use, reproduction or
          distribution of the Service; (b) providing industry standard
          functionality; (c) the Service being modified after delivery without
          ekai’s prior written authorization; or (d) Customer’s continued use of
          the allegedly infringing Service after ekai modified the Service to be
          non-infringing. If any Claim arises, ekai may, at its sole option and
          expense: (A) replace or modify the affected Service to make it
          noninfringing; (B) procure a license for Customer’s continued use of
          the affected Service; or if ekai determines (in its sole discretion)
          that (A) and (B) are not commercially viable, terminate Customer’s
          rights thereto, in which case ekai will process a prorated refund for
          the applicable prepaid unused fees for such Service covering the
          remainder of the applicable subscription period. This section states
          Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and ekai’s sole liability, with
          respect to infringement of third party intellectual property rights
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2 Customer Indemnity: Customer agrees to defend and indemnify ekai
          from and against any loss, damage, or cost arising from a third-party
          claim that Customer’s provision or use of Customer Data violates a
          third party’s rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.3 Indemnification Process: As a condition of receiving indemnity as
          described in this section, the party seeking the indemnity will
          provide the other party with: (i) prompt written notice of the claim,
          provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
          relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder except to
          the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure;
          (ii) complete control over the defence and settlement of the claim,
          provided that the indemnifying party will not settle any claim without
          the other party’s prior written permission if the settlement fails to
          unconditionally release the indemnified party from all liability
          pertaining to the claim (such permission not to be unreasonably
          withheld, delayed or conditioned); and (iii) reasonable assistance in
          connection with the defence and settlement of the claim.

        </p>
        <p>
          12.2 Assignment: Neither party will assign any of its rights or

          is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void

        <p>
          12.7 Force Majeure: Neither party shall be liable hereunder by reason

          entire agreement between Customer and ekai and supersedes any and all
          prior agreements or communications between the parties with regard to

          of Customer, and terms and conditions in such documents are of no
